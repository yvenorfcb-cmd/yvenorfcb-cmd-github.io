<p>I am a 20-year-old economics student at York University in Toronto. Prior to my studies at York, 
I completed my elementary and secondary education in French, graduating in 2023 from 
Jeunes Sans Frontières Secondary School with a French Bilingual Diploma. This bilingual background 
has shaped my academic identity and strengthened my ability to engage with diverse perspectives 
in global economic discourse.</p>

<p>Throughout my studies at York University, I have become deeply interested in the relationship between 
global economic policies and the development of emerging countries, especially in the context 
of globalization. I am particularly focused on how free trade, protectionism, and foreign 
investment can both support and undermine development. I am also interested in how the actions 
of global powers and international institutions can sometimes reproduce forms of neo-colonialism.</p>

<h2>Research Interests</h2>
<ul>
<li>How globalization affects income inequality</li>
<li>How globalization supports or hinders development</li>
<li>Whether globalization can lead to new forms of neo-colonialism</li>
</ul>
