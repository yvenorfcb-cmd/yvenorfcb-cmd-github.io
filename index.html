            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I am a 20-year-old economics student at York University in Toronto. I completed my elementary 
                and secondary education in French, graduating in 2023 from <strong>Jeunes Sans Frontières Secondary School</strong> 
                with a <strong>French Bilingual Diploma</strong>. This bilingual background has shaped my academic identity and 
                strengthened my ability to engage with diverse perspectives in global economic discourse.
            </p>
            <p>
                Throughout my studies at York University, I have become deeply interested in the relationship between 
                <strong>global economic policies</strong> and the development of emerging countries, especially in the context of 
                globalization. I am particularly focused on how free trade, protectionism, and foreign investment can both support 
                and undermine development, and how the actions of global powers and international institutions can reproduce 
                forms of <strong>neo-colonialism</strong>.

            <ul>
                <li>Effects of globalization on income inequality and development</li>
                <li>Free trade, protectionism, and their impact on emerging economies</li>
                <li>Foreign investment and its role in long-term economic resilience</li>
                <li>The influence of institutions like the IMF, World Bank, and WTO</li>

            <p>
                My goal is to contribute to policy thinking that helps emerging countries build sustainable, 
                independent, and resilient economies as they integrate into the global system.
